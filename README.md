Creating a modular penetration testing toolkit in Python is a solid project idea that simulates real-world ethical hacking tools. Below is a proposed structure, features, and a development plan for a Python-based Penetration Testing Toolkit named "PyPentest".
PyPentest/
The Penetration Testing Toolkit is a lightweight and modular security testing framework developed to assist ethical hackers and security analysts in identifying vulnerabilities across networks, systems, and applications. Implemented in Python, this toolkit provides basic automation for common penetration testing tasks such as port scanning, service enumeration, brute-force attacks, subdomain discovery, and DNS analysis.

It was built during an internship to demonstrate foundational skills in cybersecurity, scripting, and ethical hacking methodologies. The toolkit is designed for easy extension and customization, allowing users to plug in additional modules based on specific testing needs.

This implementation emphasizes:

**Automation** of repetitive penetration testing tasks

**Modularity** for adding or removing tools as needed

**Command-line** usability for real-world, scriptable engagement
